# nhanes-disease-classifier

## Abstract
In this project, we build a classifier to predict whether or not a given person has had coronary heart disease in his or her lifetime. We do so by using the formidable NHANES patient health data set, cleaning this data extensively for our purposes, and training a deep neural network on it. This paper discusses our data processing methods, our investigation of various machine learning models, our chosen deep learning process, and our preliminary results. Our model achieves success while leaving room for further improvements. We discuss possibilities for future expansion of this research, such as optimizing DNN hyperparameters and classifying on additional diseases.
